# Colabship.io â€“ Build Together, Ship Faster

Colabship.io is a minimalist platform that helps indie builders form lightweight, async-first teams to ship real products together.

Every day, thousands of developers, designers, and marketers are building side projects solo â€” not because they want to, but because forming a trustworthy team is hard. Colabship lowers the barrier to team formation with a structure that feels natural, fast, and low-risk.

On Colabship, you can create a project, define open roles (like "looking for a backend dev for 10% equity"), and invite others or let them apply. New collaborators enter a trial phase â€” a 1â€“4 week async collaboration window where the team works together, without any formal commitment.

This phase helps reduce friction, filter for commitment, and build trust before formalizing the team with a lightweight agreement. Once the trial ends, collaborators can mutually agree to share equity, revenue, or ownership â€” or simply part ways.

It's designed for people who've shipped alone and want to do it better â€” together. The platform puts collaboration, ownership, and flexibility first.

## Key features include:

- **Structured project setup** with public or invite-only roles
- **Trust-based contributor matching**
- **Built-in trial period mechanics**
- **Optional equity/revenue split agreement tools**
- **Reputation system** based on collaboration history

Colabship is not a freelance marketplace or a founder dating app â€” it's a startup lab for async builders, where shipping and real collaboration come first.

Whether you're a developer with too many ideas, a designer who wants skin in the game, or a marketer ready to co-own something â€” Colabship is where you find your crew and ship.
